# Introduction

The inspiration to build an application for documenting my trips struck me when I realized how much I had traveled, yet often struggled to remember where I had been and when. Friends frequently asked about my journeys, and I found myself forgetting key details. Additionally, locating the photos associated with each trip became a time-consuming task.

**Immer in Bewegung** is German for *always in movement*, perfectly capturing the essence of foundation of this project. The frog is the perfect mascot, symbolizing this continuous motion.

## Basic idea

Over time, most code in applications becomes obsolete. To ensure your memories are not lost to such obsolescence, the core idea of this project is to use a spreadsheet as the foundation for documentation. Spreadsheets are easy to update and are more likely to remain compatible with future technologies, making them a reliable and future-proof solution. This project is not just an application; it is also a versatile syntax that can adapt to any format you choose for presenting your data.

### Three main components

- A spreadsheet structured according to the Immer in Bewegung Trip Syntax
- A Docker container running the code
- An Immich installation (optional, for combining text documentation with photos)
